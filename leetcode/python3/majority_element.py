# Given an array of size n, find the majority element.
# The majority element is the element that appears
# more than âŒŠ n/2 âŒ‹ times.

# You may assume that the array is non-empty and the
# majority element always exist in the array.

# Example 1:

# Input: [3, 2, 3]
# Output: 3
# Example 2:

# Input: [2, 2, 1, 1, 1, 2, 2]
# Output: 2

# This solution is O(n) time complexity, O(n) space complexity
