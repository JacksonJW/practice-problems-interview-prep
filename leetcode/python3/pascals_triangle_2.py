119. Pascal's Triangle II

Given a non-negative index k where k â‰¤ 33, return the kth index row of the Pascal's triangle.

Note that the row index starts from 0.

1
1, 1
1, 2, 1
1, 3, 3, 1
1, 4, 6, 4, 1


In Pascal's triangle, each number is the sum of the two numbers directly above it.

Example:

Input: 3
Output: [1,3,3,1]

Follow up:
Could you optimize your algorithm to use only O(k) extra space?

O(n) time where n is the number of rows
O(n) space where n is the number of rows which correponds to the length of one row
